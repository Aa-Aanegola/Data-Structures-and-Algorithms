# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repositories contains the solutions to all the assignments that were a part of the data structures and algorithms course at IIIT-H. Each ```Assignment``` directory contains problem PDF's along with their corresponding solutions. The ```Lab``` directory contains code for base algos/data structures and not problems themselves(disjoint set union for example). 
## What we covered
- Stacks & Queues
- Graphs
- BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms, cycle detection, connected components
- DAG, strongly connected components, topological sort
- Disjoint set union
- Trees
- Binary trees, binary search trees, self balancing binary trees(AVL, RB tree), Tries
- Heaps
- And much more
