# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repositories contains the solutions to all the assignments that were a part of the data structures and algorithms course at IIIT-H. Each ```Assignment``` directory contains problem PDF's along with their corresponding solutions. The ```Lab``` directory contains code for base algos/data structures and not problems themselves(disjoint set union for example).
